 The Process

    Download SDL-devel-1.2.9-mingw32.tar.gz from the SDL version 1.2.9 download page. There are binary packages for several Linux distributions, too (rpm may have problems downloading directly from libsdl.org, use wget to get the packages in that case).
    Decompress the archive
    Copy SDL.dll from inside the bin folder to the your compilers bin directory (ie C:\Mingw\bin) This allows the compiler to find the dll at runtime time without having to put it in the same folder as your program or in the windows folder.
    Copy the contents of lib to your compiler's lib folder. If MinGW is installed under C:\MinGW, then this will be C:\MinGW\lib.
    Copy the complete folder SDL from inside the folder include to your compiler's include directory (for example C:\MinGW\include). Be sure to copy the folder, not the individual files.
    Optionally, copy SDL.dll to C:\Windows, too. This will save you from copying the dll to each and every project directory while developing. Be cautious, however, not to find yourself in DLL hell afterwards.
    Screw the rest (in particular, forget about sdlconfig - it will not work)

It is of course possible to keep the library and include files in different locations than the ones stated above. In that case, you will have to add those locations to the compiler options. However, be sure not to add the SDL folder to include paths, but its parent folder, as all SDL programs expect the headers to be inside a separate SDL folder.
